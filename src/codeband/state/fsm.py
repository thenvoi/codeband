"""Per-subtask finite-state machine (RFC Workstream 2).

The FSM gates *effects*, not the Conductor's routing. A subtask advances
through a fixed lifecycle:

    planned → assigned → in_progress → verify_pending → review_pending
            → review_passed → merge_pending → merged
                            ↘ needs_rebase → in_progress (rebase rework)
                            ↘ review_failed → in_progress
                            ↘ blocked
                            ↘ abandoned

    (``merge_pending`` may also exit to ``needs_rebase`` — execution-time SHA
    drift or a conflicted PR — or to ``blocked`` on a residual merge failure;
    both are driven by ``cb-phase merge``, the sole sanctioned merge path.)

:data:`VALID_TRANSITIONS` encodes every legal edge keyed by
``(current_state, caller_role)`` — exactly the RFC table plus the Stage-2
merge edge (``review_passed → needs_rebase → in_progress``, the Mergemaster's
stale-branch send-back). Two cross-cutting wildcards are enforced in
:func:`_is_allowed` rather than enumerated per state: the Conductor may
*abandon*, and the Watchdog may *block*, any non-terminal subtask regardless
of its current state.

The ``review_passed → merge_pending`` edge is additionally gated (Stage-2):
inside the transition's exclusive transaction, :func:`check_merge_eligibility`
must pass for the exact ``head_sha`` being merged — every verdict leg in the
task's ``required_verdicts`` snapshot needs a passing record pinned to that
SHA (see :data:`_VERDICT_PASS_STATES`). An ineligible attempt raises
:class:`MergeNotEligibleError` and writes nothing. The FSM also owns task
completion: the transition that merges a task's *last* subtask promotes
``tasks.status`` to ``'completed'`` in the same transaction.

:func:`transition` is the only mutation path. It auto-creates the subtask row
(via :meth:`StateStore.ensure_subtask`), then — inside a single
``BEGIN EXCLUSIVE`` transaction against the same SQLite file — re-reads the
current state, validates ``(current_state, caller_role)``, writes the new
state and appends a ``transition_log`` row. An illegal edge or a wrong caller
role raises :class:`InvalidTransitionError` and writes nothing.

    Four effects are intrinsic to the FSM (not the caller's responsibility):

    * **Review-round counting.** Entering ``review_failed`` increments the
      subtask's durable ``review_round`` in the same transaction — one failed
      review is one round.
    * **The review-round cap.** A ``review_failed → in_progress`` rework is
      rejected once ``review_round`` has reached ``max_review_rounds``; the
      subtask must instead go to ``blocked`` (escalation). The check reads the
      committed count inside the exclusive transaction, so it is race-safe and
      survives a crash/reopen (the count is durable). This bounds a productive
      loop that the watchdog's stall cap never catches.
    * **Rebase-round counting + cap.** Entering ``needs_rebase`` increments the
      subtask's durable ``rebase_rounds`` in the same transaction (one
      merge-gate send-back = one rebase round) — and is rejected once the count
      has reached ``max_rebase_rounds``; the subtask must instead go to
      ``blocked``. An active rebase loop writes fresh transition rows every
      cycle, so the watchdog's stall cap by construction never fires on it; this
      counter is what bounds it. The merge leg (``cli/merge.py``) checks the cap
      proactively and escalates with ``BLOCKED [rebase_cap_reached]``.
    * **The merge-eligibility gate (Stage-2).** Entering ``merge_pending``
      additionally requires :func:`check_merge_eligibility` to pass for the
      ``head_sha`` argument — every verdict leg in the task's
      ``required_verdicts`` snapshot must have a passing record pinned to
      exactly that SHA. The evaluation runs on this transaction's exclusive
      connection (race-safe against concurrent verdict writes); an ineligible
      attempt raises :class:`MergeNotEligibleError`, is logged with its
      machine-readable reasons, and writes nothing. Because
      :func:`transition` is the only mutation path, there is no way into
      ``merge_pending`` that skips the check.
    * **Task completion (Stage-2).** The transition that moves a task's *last*
      subtask to ``merged`` promotes the task itself to
      ``tasks.status = 'completed'`` in the same transaction — strictly
      *every* subtask row must be ``merged`` (an ``abandoned`` sibling blocks
      promotion), and only an ``'active'`` task is promoted (``'superseded'``
      keeps its status).

    ``store``, ``max_review_rounds`` and ``max_rebase_rounds`` are keyword-only
    so the positional signature matches the RFC while still letting callers
    (and tests) inject the concrete store and override the caps (e.g. from
    ``config.AgentsConfig.max_review_rounds`` / ``max_rebase_rounds``).

    ``head_sha`` (keyword-only, default ``None``) pins the transition to the
    exact commit it was recorded against — ``cb-phase`` passes the worktree's
    ``git rev-parse HEAD`` on the verify and review outcome transitions, so a
    verdict can later be checked against what the PR actually merges. Stored
    verbatim in the ``transition_log`` row; ``NULL`` for every other caller
    and for legacy rows. The merge-eligibility gate reads it: a transition to
    ``merge_pending`` must pass the SHA it is merging at (``None`` fails
    closed unless the task's snapshot is the explicit ungated opt-out).
